## How it Works ?
1.The Tic Tac Toe project works by displaying a 3x3 grid where two players take turns clicking on squares to place their symbol (either "X" or "O"). Each player's move is tracked by the game, and after every 
  turn, the game checks for a winner by comparing if a player has aligned three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If a winner is found, the game ends and announces the result. If all squares are 
  filled without a winner, the game declares a draw. Players can reset the game to start a new match, and the entire experience is handled using HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for game logic.
